The EValuator is a prototype which demonstrates an approach to integrated planning across several disciplines (land use, sustainability, energy, transport). It aims to encourage cross-domain collaboration by presenting ***data*** in the form of contextually presented layers and ***expert knowledge*** in the form of simple estimation models. This puts the ability to explore scheme feasibility in the hands of non-domain experts.

The specific use case for the tool is positioning bulk EV charging within an area (e.g. Local Authority), considering the impact on the energy network and the contribution to meeting Net Zero targets.

The prototype presents the art of the possible with data that is available and openly accessible today. It demonstrates how processes and decision-making can be streamlined through earlier cross-collaboration between the three sectors.
